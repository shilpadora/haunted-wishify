# Audio Placeholder Files

The audio files referenced in the HTML are missing. This is expected for a demo.
The AudioManager will gracefully handle missing audio files and fall back to synthetic sounds.

To add real audio files, place them in this directory:
- whisper.mp3 / whisper.ogg
- chains.mp3 / chains.ogg  
- creak.mp3 / creak.ogg

The builder will work without these files, just without the atmospheric sound effects.
